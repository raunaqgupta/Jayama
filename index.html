          <p>
          I remember when you would piece<br>
          together patches of my torn<br>
          uniform the way you pieced<br>
          together broken affections.<br>
          The little <span class="highlight" data-meaning="needle" data-language="hindi">sui</span> and <span class="highlight" data-meaning="thread" data-language="hindi">dhaaga</span><br>
          you kept close to the <br>
          turmeric container <br>
          (life’s first aid kit)<br>
          sewed many a severed <br>
          fabric of love. <br>
          you doctored into giving<br>
          this family,<br>
          our clothes<br>
          and my patience a longer life.<br>
          </p>

          <p>
          When I step into the <br>
          precipice of a world, <br>
          i promise<br>
          you wouldn’t recognise, <br>
          I look for your hand<br>
          over my shoulder<br>
          the same way I<br>
          did on my bicycle rides. <br>
          You’d run after me<br>
          in an <span class="highlight" data-meaning="a nine yard saree" data-language="tamil">ombodhu gajam</span><br>
          whose graceful drapes <br>
          and firm knots <br>
          could give governments<br>
          lessons in efficiency.<br>
          I’d notice parents in the garden<br>
          laugh at you <br>
          I’d notice how you only<br>
          had eyes for me; <br>
          the world’s condescension  <br>
          never qualified to <br>
          take up space <br>
          and soil in your backyard.<br>
          </p>

          <p>
          As I gobble down this <br>
          500 rupee pasta, <br>
          I’d remember the time <br>
          when food wasn’t valued in <br>
          money but <br>
          in the willingness to <br>
          share. <br>
          We’d surround you in a<br>
          semi-circle till<br>
          you’d drop a spoon <br>
          of <span class="highlight" data-meaning="curd rice" data-language="tamil">thair saadam</span> into <br>
          eager palms. <br>
          You’d see <br>
          our barely contained hunger<br>
          and ignore it -<br>
          we had to wait our turns, <br>
          we had to wait <br>
          for the spoon to return<br>
          we had to learn to share<br>
          what was never ours to keep. <br>
          I look for you, <span class="highlight" data-meaning="grandmother" data-language="tamil">paati</span>,<br>
          in the centre of <br>
          my semi-circle of <br>
          hungry ambitions, <br>
          not knowing when<br>
          to extend my palm <br>
          and when<br>
          to await my turn.<br>
          </p>

          <p>
          With you, <br>
          I spent my childhood in<br>
          careless abandon, <br>
          but you left before <br>
          you could tell me when<br>
          it stops - <br>
          I now spend<br>
          my adulthood letting go, <br>
          without the grace<br>
          of your kindness.<br>
          As I try to find my voice<br>
          in a world determined <br>
          to drown it, <br>
          I listen to the <br>
          distant echoes of <br>
          your lessons. <br>
          Amid false leaders, <br>
          a reckless people, <br>
          apathy <br>
          and fear, <br>
          I look for the fortitude <br>
          with which you <br>
          lifted us from the poverty <br>
          of our hearts<br>
          in a one-room-kitchen.<br>
          </p>

          <p>
          I look for you<br>
          at the edge of Decision, <br>
          hoping my voice <br>
          inherited your assertion. <br>
          I reminisce  <br>
          how you taught me <br>
          “properly” is what I make of it,<br>
          so I sit as I please. <br>
          I can never tuck in my saree’s drapes <br>
          the way you did, <br>
          but i drape your values <br>
          in them tight -<br>
          each lesson in each fold <br>
          held close to my navel. <br>
          Like you, <span class="highlight" data-meaning="grandmother" data-language="tamil">paati</span>,<br>
          I am any woman I want to be<br>
          Any person I want to become. <br>
          A potential wasted <br>
          or a privilege gained, <br>
          I hope to find them a corner<br>
          in your backyard<br>
          and water them<br>
          till their green tendons, <br>
          become poems to you.<br>
